    question: "What exactly is Lumen?",
    answer:
      "Lumen is an analytics workspace for product teams. It connects to your warehouse, lets anyone explore events without SQL, and turns the answers into dashboards your whole company can read.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does setup take?",
    answer:
      "Most teams see their first dashboard within an hour. Connect your warehouse, pick the tables that hold your events, and Lumen maps users, sessions and properties for you.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which data sources do you support?",
    answer:
      "All the major cloud warehouses, Postgres and MySQL, plus event streams through our SDKs for web, iOS, Android and server-side languages. New connectors ship every month.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you copy our data?",
    answer:
      "No. Queries run directly in your warehouse, and only aggregated results are cached — encrypted and for at most 24 hours. Your raw events never leave your infrastructure.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is pricing calculated?",
    answer:
      "By the number of tracked users per month, not by seats — invite your whole company at no extra cost. If you go over your limit, we'll let you know before anything changes on your bill.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can we self-host Lumen?",
    answer:
      "Self-hosting is available on the Enterprise plan as a container you run in your own cloud account, with the same release cadence as our hosted version.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens to our dashboards if we leave?",
    answer:
      "You can export every dashboard as SQL and every chart as CSV or PNG at any time. After cancellation your workspace stays readable for 30 days, then it's permanently deleted.",
  },
