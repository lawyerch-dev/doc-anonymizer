    question: "How does the 14-day free trial work?",
    answer:
      "Sign up with your work email and you get every feature for 14 days — no credit card needed. When the trial ends you can pick a plan or drop to the free tier; nothing is deleted either way.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I change plans later?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Upgrades take effect immediately and are prorated to the day. Downgrades apply at the end of your current billing period, so you never lose time you've paid for.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who counts as a paid seat?",
    answer:
      "Anyone who can create or edit work. Viewers, commenters and external guests are free and unlimited on every paid plan.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I import from the tools we already use?",
    answer:
      "Our importers bring over projects, docs, comments and attachments from most popular project and wiki tools in a few minutes. For large workspaces, our team will run the migration with you.",
  },
  {
    question: "Where is our data stored, and is it secure?",
    answer:
      "Data is encrypted in transit and at rest, stored in the EU or US region of your choice, and backed up every hour. We're SOC 2 Type II audited and publish our security report on request.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does it work offline?",
    answer:
      "The desktop and mobile apps keep your recent projects available offline and sync your changes the moment you reconnect.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer discounts for non-profits or education?",
    answer:
      "Registered non-profits, schools and universities get 50% off any paid plan. Send us proof of status from your organisation's email and we'll apply it the same day.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I cancel my subscription?",
    answer:
      "From Settings → Billing, in two clicks. You keep access until the end of the period, and you can export your whole workspace at any time.",
  },
